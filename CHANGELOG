HEAD:
* If the initial window width is less than MinimalWindowSize (default is 500), use full titlebar.

0.11:
* Remember titlebar width settings for each window classes.

0.1:
* Use Aurorae themes
* Revert to traditional, full-width titlebar for dialog and toolbox windows.
* Ctrl-MouseWheel grows/shrinks titlebar.
* Transparent theme has system color as the background. So you can set the "titlebar color" in SystemSettings to tweak the tone of the theme. (Thanks for furumaro's suggestion.)
* Smoothed corners of the titlebar. (Thanks for IkaCoast's suggestion.)

0.03:
* Maximize button uses "restore" image when maximized.
* Use hover/pressed image.
* Fixed preview.

0.02:
Borrowed artwork from Chrome Aurorae (http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Chrome+Aurorae?content=119106). Button animations still missing.

0.01:
A minimal implementation that barely works.
