HEAD:

* If the initial window width is less than MinimalWindowSize (default is 500), use full titlebar.

* Use Aurorae's KNewStuff file. We used a renamed file (chromi.knsrc
  vs. aurorae.knsrc), but then themes installed in Chromi is shown as
  uninstalled in Aurorae, and vice versa. Now Chromi installs the
  untouched aurorae.knsrc, and only do so when it's not found.

  Note all themes previously installed in Chromi will still shown as
  uninstalled in Aurorae. You'll need to install them again.


0.11:

* Remember titlebar width settings for each window classes.


0.1:

* Use Aurorae themes

* Revert to traditional, full-width titlebar for dialog and toolbox
  windows.

* Ctrl-MouseWheel grows/shrinks titlebar.

* Transparent theme has system color as the background. So you can set
  the "titlebar color" in SystemSettings to tweak the tone of the
  theme. (Thanks for furumaro's suggestion.)

* Smoothed corners of the titlebar. (Thanks for IkaCoast's suggestion.)


0.03:
* Maximize button uses "restore" image when maximized.

* Use hover/pressed image.

* Fixed preview.


0.02: 

Borrowed artwork from Chrome Aurorae
(http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Chrome+Aurorae?content=119106). Button
animations still missing.


0.01:

A minimal implementation that barely works.
