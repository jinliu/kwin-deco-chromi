This project won't be possible without help from the following people/projects:

Google Chrome
Inspired the embedded title bar concept.

Amir Taaki's "Nitrogen minimal mod" (http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/KDE+4+Nitrogen+minimal+mod?content=109355)
Showed me how to actually embed the title bar. I'd never think it possible before seen it.

Martin Gräßlin's "Aurorae Theme Engine" (http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Aurorae+Theme+Engine?content=107158)
Chromi uses Aurorae themes directly.
Also, config.cpp and themeconfig.cpp are copied from Aurorae and slightly modified.
