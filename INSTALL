You need Debian package kdelibs6-dev and xorg-dev (or corresponding
packages in your Linux distribution) to build this.

Unpack the archive, and run the following commands from a shell:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`
make
sudo make install
kbuildsycoca4

If you are already using an old version of Chromi and updating to a
new version, you may need to run "kwin --replace&" for the change to
take effect.
