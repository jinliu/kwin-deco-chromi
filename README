This is a titlebar-less decoration, inspired by Google Chrome, and
Nitrogen minimal mod
(http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/KDE+4+Nitrogen+minimal+mod?content=109355).

Instead of the traditional full-width title bar, a mini title bar is
placed at the upper-right corner of the application window --- where
usually is unused by the application menu bar.

Because notebooks today have very wide screens but limited in height,
I think this saving in the vertical space can be good.


Build
=====

Please following instructions in the INSTALL file.


Usage
=====

Just use the small bar in the top-right corner as your good old titlebar.

Ctrl-MouseWheel grows/shrinks the bar. So if your window title is
really long, you can make the bar wider.


Theme
=====

Begin with v0.1, Chromi uses themes from Aurorae Theme Engine
(http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Aurorae+Theme+Engine?content=107158).
You can download dozens of Aurorae themes in the configuration UI.

Chromi ships with Scnd101's "Chrome Aurorae" theme
(http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Chrome+Aurorae?content=119106)
as the default. If you customized the theme SVG files in older
versions, please move SVG files from /usr/share/kde4/apps/chromi to
/usr/share/kde4/aurorae/themes/chrome. Chromi no longer load theme
files from the former directory.
